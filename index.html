                Clonetab’s ERP cloning does not stop at Database Cloning or at adcfgclone.pl (EBS). It goes much beyond this and can be a true end-to-end cloning solution. As an example, in case of Oracle e-Business Suite, the cloning includes performing post clone steps like retention of profile options, changing apps, Weblogic, sysadmin or EBS schema passwords (like GL, AP, XX* schemas), etc.
                
                Clonetab is the ERP application aware cloning and virtualization software in the market.
                It has in-depth understanding of the Oracle EBS, Oracle PeopleSoft, SAP technology stack. Oracle EBS cloning steps can significantly change based on the patchset levels (like TXK & AD). These differences due to patchset levels are fed to the engine as and when there is a new patchset, and cloning is performed according to the patchset level. This makes Clonetab software unique and the only software of its kind in the market.</p>

                         It can also provide an integrated solution for virtualization, cloning, Disaster Recovery, Backups and Oracle EBS Snapshots.</p>

                            The engines are deeply EBS & PS aware and can identify the major releases (e.g. R12.1, R12.2) and patchset levels like AD, TXK and executes the clone commands accordingly. The platform provides options to retain EBS/PS specific options like profile option retention, Concurrent/Process scheduler setups retention, EBS users with responsibilities retention, Database links, Directories retention, workflows setups and many more options, resulting in a true end-to-end ERP clone.</p>

        <h2>Deeply Application-aware snapshots</h2>
CTSnap is aware of internals of Oracle EBS, Snapshots includes EBS appl_top and other binaries, preserves the apps and other passwords at that specific point in time etc. App/DB consistent snapshots eliminates any disconnects between appl_top and database during backups due to time difference.
Travel to any snapshot in any incarnation
Multiple levels of snapshot incarnation can be created. Travel from any level to any level with few clicks. During any major change, take a CTSnap in minutes, if the change fails, travel back to the snapshot (revert), in minutes.

CTSnaps are ERP application-aware. Snapshots include both application and database. For applications like Oracle EBS, just reverting database snapshot will disconnect application from DB. CTSnap includes both Database and application in the snapshot. Reverting to that snap will revert the whole application and not just the database.
